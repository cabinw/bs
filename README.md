### Project BS
==

Project BS(Bookmark System) is a project created to collect bookmarks by TAGs in a version controll system.
Users can **fork** or **clone** other's bookmark colletions.

A **fork** action here means to just put another user's one collection to your own **Collection Wall** and this collection will update as the other user updates it.
A **clone** action here means to just clone a collection and this collection won't update as the original collection updates.

##TODO:
1, Show the bookmark collections as a start page.
2, Support modify actions.
3, Support version-control-like system.
4, Support search actions.
